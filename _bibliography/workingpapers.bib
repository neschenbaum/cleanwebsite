  keywords = {Reputation, institutions, uncertainty, dark web, drugs},
  abstract = {This paper studies reputation in the online market for illegal drugs in which no legal
  institutions exist to alleviate uncertainty. Trade takes place on platforms that offer
  rating systems for sellers, thereby providing an observable measure of reputation.
  The analysis exploits the fact that one of the two dominant platforms unexpectedly disappeared.
  Re-entering sellers reset their rating. The results show that on average prices decreased by up
  to 9% and that a 1% increase in rating causes a price increase of 1%. Ratings and prices recover
  after about three months. We calculate that identified good types earn 1,650 USD more per week.},

  title    = {Dynamic Monopoly Pricing with Multiple Varieties: Trading Up},
  month    = dec,
  year     = {2021},
  abstract = {This paper studies dynamic monopoly pricing for a class of settings that includes multiple durable, multiple rental, or a mix of varieties. We show that the driving force behind pricing dynamics is the seller's incentive to switch consumers - buyers and non-buyers - to higher-valued consumption options by lowering prices ("trading up"). If consumers cannot be traded up from the static optimal allocation, pricing dynamics do not emerge in equilibrium. If consumers can be traded up, pricing dynamics arise until all trading-up opportunities are exhausted. We study the conditions under which pricing dynamics end in finite time and characterize the final prices at which dynamics end.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a nonparametric approach to empirically determine geographic
  market size. I exploit highly detailed spatial data and provide estimates of business-stealing
  effects across distance by studying the impact of store entry on competitors
  in an increasing range to the entry site. Entropy balancing is employed to control
  for systematic differences across local markets. I estimate that markets for Swiss
  grocery retailing stores are highly localized in a tight four kilometer radius. I further
  document evidence that the impact weakens with increasing distance and that
  smaller retailers compete in a more narrow market of only two kilometers in size.},

  month    = dec,
  year     = {2021},
  abstract = {This paper develops a formal framework to assess policies of learning algorithms in economic games. We investigate whether reinforcement-learning agents with collusive pricing policies can successfully extrapolate collusive behavior from training to the market. We find that in testing environments collusion consistently breaks down. Instead, we observe static Nash play. We then show that restricting algorithms' strategy space can make algorithmic collusion robust, because it limits overfitting to rival strategies. Our findings suggest that policy-makers should focus on firm behavior aimed at coordinating algorithm design in order to make collusive policies robust},
