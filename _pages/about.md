I am a researcher and consultant at the intersection of game theory, computation, and market regulation.

I design incentives for startups and Web3 protocols, support companies in antitrust investigations, and help regulators understand the economics of digital markets/AI. You can find more details on my consulting work <a href="https://neschenbaum.github.io/consulting/">here</a>).
My latest research funded by the Hasler Foundation integrates a programmatic, modular framework of mathematical games (see the <a href="https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs">repository</a> for details) with machine learning libraries (see <a href="https://neschenbaum.github.io/projects/2_project/">here</a>). You can find details on my various research activities <a href="https://neschenbaum.github.io/projects/">here</a>).
