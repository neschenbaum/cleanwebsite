I am a postdoc and lecturer at the University of St. Gallen and consultant at Swisseconomics/Cryptecon. I apply game theory and machine learning, design incentives, and work on competition policy in digital markets.

My latest research funded by the Hasler Foundation integrates a programmatic, modular framework of mathematical games (see the <a href="https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs">repository</a> for details) with machine learning libraries (Ray and Rlib in particular; see the underlying research project <a href="https://neschenbaum.github.io/projects/2_project/">here</a>). My postdoc is funded by a four-year research grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation to study dynamic pricing (see the full project <a href="https://neschenbaum.github.io/projects/1_project/">here</a>). I have also studied the role of seller ratings on darknet platforms empirically (the research project is <a href="https://neschenbaum.github.io/projects/3_project/">here</a>).
